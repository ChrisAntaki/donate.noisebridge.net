Remove PayPal as a donation method. We want to deprecate PayPal donations entirely and the first step of doing so is to stop advertising them to new donors.

Update to Rails 5.0.0-beta3. Fix a bunch of deprecation warnings that came with this. 

Introduced project-page partials which allow optional content to be rendered alongside the donation form.

Adjustments to the `SecureHeaders` configuration such that the CSP reports are resolved. 

Change the default home page to show a list of recent donations as well as a list of projects that have been donated to recently. This replaces the leaderboard that previously filled the right column.
