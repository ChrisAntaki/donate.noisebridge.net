    <h3>Noisebridge: a hackerspace needs your help!</h3>
    <p>Our 2169 Mission Street lease is up in August and we're in a crunch to find a new space and increase the amount of money we have to be able to afford the new space. We need # million dollars to buy or # thousand dollars to lease a new space. Please make a donation now, and setup a recurring monthly donation, to support non-profit donation-based open to the public Hacking in San Francisco.</p>
